3.	Products: Here is a combination of tables need to be combined to a single response. First of all the initial filter has to do with the fact the any of the returned product should have bool01=1 and to have at least 1 image from mtrl_files table associated and last to have all 3 translations completed Greek, English Italian from mtrans table. Another important factor is the VAT which is the code of the related softone sync at this page https://hdctool.wwa.gr/admin/soft-fpt you have to return the percentage and not the code, the same for country and mcountry fields https://hdctool.wwa.gr/admin/soft-countries you should return the int. code. Now the pricing is a little more complex and should be calculated based on MTRMARK field which is related with soft_brands table. From soft_brands table you should check discount field and you should calculate pricew from mtrl_product minus the discount percentage. We also need to have to display all product_features and product_compatibility. The request should be able to filter the response base on brand, category, group, subgroup. Can you propose me a request and a response json
